algorithms project1 
The aim of the project is to produce an output of an algorithms implementation that we have studied in the semester 
by JavaScript language , such as warshall is an algorithm to find the transitive closure matrix of directed graph,
Floyd is an algorithm to find the shortest path in weighted graph ,
prim is a greedy technique to finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph by two data structure array 
and priority queue , Kruskal is a greedy technique to finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph 
and Dijkstra finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
The outcome of milestone 1 is the traversal order of DFS  and BFS algorithm  with weight input.
the outcome of milestone 2 is the same as milestone 1 in traversal order of DFS and BFS algorithm, 
the difference is adding the transitive closure matrix using DFS ,
warshall algorithm and distance matrix using Floyd , and the minimum spanning tree using prim algorithm.
The outcome of milestone 3 is the same as milestone 2 in transitive closure matrix and distance matrix and traversal order 
of DFS and BFS algorithm ,the difference is another implementation for prim algorithm and add Dijkstra algorithm to 
find the shortest path.
